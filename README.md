# Sparkle
A repository for Sparkle, Oslo Prides React component library.

## How to use

### Install
`npm install @oslopride/sparkle`


### Use
```jsx
import { Button } from '@oslopride/sparkle';

const YourCoolComponent = () => <Button>This is a button!</Button>
```

## Libraries
Sparkle's main setup to create components revolves around [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/). Styled System is used to extend every component with utility props that uses values set in the theme file(s). This makes it possible to have a defined list of spacing values that can be consistently used across the components, all centralized in one place. See the [Styled System API](https://styled-system.com/api) for example usage of the various utlity props.

## CI/CD
There is an automated Github Action workflow set up that will do checks for any pull request. It uses [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to do automatic semantic versioning of releases. After a successful merge, the workflow will create and release a new NPM package in the Github registry.

## Contributing
1. `git clone git@github.com:oslopride/sparkle.git && cd sparkle`
2. `yarn`
3. Create a new branch. We are not using any fancy feature branches or the likes, so name them whatever makes sense. Fixing a problem with the Button component? `git checkout -b fix-button` will probably suffice!
4. Do your work!
5. Do your best attempt to adhere to the commit guidelines by using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) structure for your commit messages. If you never used it before it might be a bit confusing, but don't worry, it's pretty easy to get used to!
We use semantic versioning for our library, which means a version like `2.4.1` means `2` is the MAJOR version, `4` is the MINOR version, and `1` is the PATCH version. When adding a new **feature**, the MINOR version will be increased. This is the most common version increase. **Fixing** something will increase the PATCH version. A MAJOR version should not occur very often, and is mostly aimed at when we make any breaking changes to our public API, e.g. we totally change how a component works, the props it takes, or something similar.
 So, how does this work in practice? It's as simple as when you create a new **feature**, make your commit message like this example: `feat(Button): add cool prop`. **Fixing** something: `fix(Button): make cool prop optional`.
6. `yarn test` to make sure you didn't break any tests.
7. Push your branch and do a pull request!

Confused about any step, intimidated or not sure how to do something? Just ask your questions to anyone on our Slack channel #designsystem, or send a private message to Roger, Eullin or Siddise. We are all pretty nice and helpful, promise! üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
